Pre-meeting agenda:
- Come up with a schedule for deadline

Meeting notes:
- We get feedback from the proposal and have the chance to redeem some points by reviewing it
  - Confirm statistical analysis part
- Have results by the end of March because Dr. Sun will join probably week of March 23 or March 30 (to be confirmed)
- Finish the first 4 parts of results as fast as possible so there is still time for machine learning (mostly indicator taxa)
- Try to have the phyloseq object ready to analyse by the end of this week (Leticia)

Proposed Schedule:
- Have a good idea of what each of us has to do by the next meeting (March 3rd), so we can discuss if there are any questions
- Get the figures for alpha/beta diversity ready by March 8th (can still discuss a little about it if there is any questions on March 10th meeting)
- Start Machine Learning right after that and get it done before the meeting Evelyn joins
