# Meeting notes
* need to set an agenda for each meeting → put agenda in Github repository
* create Github repository for the group (add all members into same repository) + add Evelyn + Ritu
* during meeting, take turns talking/taking meeting notes
* update Github regularly (everyone should add at least 1 thing so that come up as “contributors”)

## For external data set
* look for the paper (16S specifically with data available i.e accession number)
* compile list of papers to send to Evelyn
* would need to send this by end of this week

## For ms dataset

* explore smoking and diet parameters separately, then compare
