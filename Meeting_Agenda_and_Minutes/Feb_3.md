# February 3rd pre-meeting notes

## NASA datasets that work

- Space environmental factor impacts upon murine colon microbiota and mucosal homeostasis (OSD-72)
  https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-72
- Temporal dynamics of the gut microbiota in people sharing a confined environment, a 520-day ground-based space simulation, MARS500 (OSD-191)
  https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-191
- Reproducible changes in gut microbiome reveal a shift in microbial and host metabolism during spaceflight (OSD-212)
  https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-212
- Specific Host Metabolite and Gut Microbiome Alterations Are Associated with Bone-loss During Spaceflight (OSD-417)
  https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-417
- Salivary microbiome sequencing of astronauts (OSD-280)

## Lila novel research idea

Research question: How does the ISS’ environmental microbiome affect the observed dysbiotic shifts in human oral microbiome during spaceflight?

Datasets: use OSD-280 (astronaut salivary microbiome) + OSD-72 (ISS environmental surface microbes)

Analysis: 
- quantify % of astronaut salivary microbiome that originates from ISS surfaces
- identify shared ASVs, see if certain ISS microbes are found in astronaut’s oral microbiome (pre-flight vs during vs post-flight)
- compare the diversity of human-associated microbes in the ISS environment surfaces to the expected decrease in diversity in astronaut oral microbiome (i.e do ISS surfaces containing more human-associated microbes stabilize the astronaut’s salivary microbiome?)
